0.7.4b1
Standardised scripts with parameters - all scripts now have an -h parameter
Improved update script
Altered copy_to_sysdirs.sh to reference a csv file /git/scripts/filepermissions to use as a source when copying & setting permissions
Added more logs to /raspi_secure/clear_logs.sh
Cleaned up output of clear_logs.sh and set_defaults.sh
Removed lots of commented out that were used during initial debugging
Removed copy_to_gitdir.sh - this was only required when I wasn't using Git properly :)
Set up daily downloading of latest version file from GitHub raw servers (for update checking)
Configured two tmpfs files mounted on /var/log/raspipass and /var/log/apache2 to reduce SD use
Added configuration in copy_to_sysdirs.sh to create these mount points in fstab if they do not exist (reboot required after)
Moved almost every dynamic RaspiPass file (eg logs, dynamic config) to /var/log/raspipass
