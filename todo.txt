-Timezone/locale adjustment
	Can't be done using wifi locale due to countries that span multiple timezones.
	Can it be done as a headless command?
	Can the wifi region then be inferred?
-Reset to defaults option on configuration tab - use US as default?
-Track previously-used MAC addresses to prevent chance of repeating the same AP within Nintendo's time limit 
-Whitelist Raspbian repositories for apt-get 
-apt-get upgrade method from web frontend?
-Installation script to set up users & directories
	This will allow downloading of git repo and installation without having to download RaspiPass image
	Will need to install necessary packages (eg macchanger, hostapd, randomize-lines, apache2, php)
	Will need to create raspi user
	Will need to create /raspipass and /raspi_secure directories and set permissions
	Will need to set raspi and www-data users as sudoers
	Will need to then run copy_to_sysdirs.sh script and direct user to open Web UI
